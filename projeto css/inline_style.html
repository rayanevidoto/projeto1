<p class="azul"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the <br>printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley<br> of type and scrambled it to make
    a
    type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br> electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker<br> including versions
    of
    Lorem Ipsum.

</p><br><br>
<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.<br> Sections 1.10.32 and
    1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original <br>form, accompanied
    by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
